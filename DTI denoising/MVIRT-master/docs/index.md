# Introduction

In many applications measured data appears nonlinear, i.e. restricted in a certain range and equipped with a different distance measure. For example measuring angles in [InSAR imaging](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar) or when working on the phase of complex valued wavelets. Other applications include denoising in several color spaces like RGB, HSV and CB. These data live on the circle S1, the sphere S2 and vector spaces of combined real valued and phase valued data (S1)m×Rn. Furthermore, in [Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI) every data item of an image is given by an r×r  symmetric positive definite matrix, i.e. from the space Sym(r). Often, all these data are obstructed by noise due to measurement or data transfer. All mentioned spaces are (products of) manifold(s). A very common model for denoising is the well known ROF-model of TV denoising, which was recently generalised to manifolds and has several generalisations itself to overcome the well known stair casing effect. This package provides an easy-to-use Toolbox for processing manifold valued data. Several examples illustrate and explain the usage of the Toolbox.
