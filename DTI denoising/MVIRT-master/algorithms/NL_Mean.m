% NL_Mean(M, F, patch_size, window_size, k, sigma_patch, sigma_weights)
% Calculates a denoised image Res by an non local mean, where the similar
% pixels have similiar neighborhoods
%
% INPUT:
% M             manifold
% F             given image ManDim x ImgDim
% patch_size    size of patches we compare, must be odd
% window_size   size of box around each pixel in which we search similar
%               patches, must be odd
% K             number of neighbors for each pixels. 
% sigma_patch   standard deviation of guassian for patch comparison (center more important than outer pixels)
% sigma_weights standard deviation of guassian for computation of actual
%               weights
% OPTIONAL
% center_element ['m'] Char indicating which weight to use for the center
%                   patch before averaging, 'm' maximum over neighbors
%                                           'z' dist=0 i.e. w = 1
% OUTPUT:
% Res           Restored manifold valued image
